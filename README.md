# ICS4UI Final Project: Calculator
This is a primative calculator, intended to resemble the vintage calculator aesthetic.

Still maintains order of operations and other decently complex tasks.

The calculator has function buttons (ex: sin, cos, tan) as well as numeric buttons (ex: 1, 2, 3, pi). 

The following is a list of the function of each button:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
* 2nd - changes the function of some buttons (ex: sin to sin^-)
	 * 2nd function: 1st - returns to original 1st functions (ex: sin^- to sin)

* CLEAR - clears the calculation window and answer window
	* 2nd function: OFF - closes the program and window

* Function buttons - (ex: sin, root, square...ect) evaluates the last numeric inputted using the function pressed
	* 2nd - evaluates with an alternate version of the function (ex: sin^- to sin)

* Numeric buttons - (ex: 1, 2, 3, pi) no context needed
