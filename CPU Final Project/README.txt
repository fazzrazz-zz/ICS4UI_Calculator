The calculator has function buttons (ex: sin, cos, tan) as well as numeric buttons (ex: 1, 2, 3, pi). The calculator works similarly to that of an old sharp calculator as far as execution goes. 

The following is a list of the function of each button:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
2nd - changes the function of some buttons (ex: sin to sin^-)
	2nd function: 1st - returns to original 1st functions (ex: sin^- to sin)
CLEAR - clears the calculation window and answer window
	2nd function: OFF - closes the program and window
Function buttons - (ex: sin, root, square...ect) evaluates the last numeric inputted using the function pressed
	2nd - evaluates with an alternate version of the function (ex: sin^- to sin)
Numeric buttons - (ex: 1, 2, 3, pi) no context needed
	2nd - none 


Due to time restrictions, some buttons dont work



Things to try
	- 1 + 1 sin *=*
	- 1 + 2 *=*
